# Unified Recon Tool

## Introduction
A modular, fast, and resource-efficient recon tool combining the best methodologies from ReconFTW, Bbot, Rs0n, and others. Supports passive and active subdomain enumeration, live host checking, takeover detection, content discovery, and vulnerability scanning.

## Features
- Modular architecture
- Async execution for speed
- Resource monitoring
- Futuristic CLI with rich progress bars and logs
- Two modes: default (fast) and deep (comprehensive)
- Supports single, list, and wildcard targets
- Clean, deduplicated output
- Robust error handling

## Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Install external tools (amass, subfinder, assetfinder, httpx, nuclei, subjack, waybackurls, gau, ffuf, jq, curl).

## Usage

python recon_tool.py example.com -m deep -o ./output_dir

## Output
Outputs are saved in timestamped directories under `output/`. Includes subdomains, live hosts, takeover results, content discovery URLs, vulnerability scan results, and a summary.
